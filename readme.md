## Supported Questionnaire Input Types

The `psa-scr-qst-tst` package supports multiple questionnaire input types, determining how answers are retrieved, submitted, and managed during usage. These modes are defined as follows:

### **Repeatable (`PSA_QST_INP_TYP_REP`)**
- **Behavior**: A new set of answers is created every time the questionnaire is filled. Existing answers are not retrieved or edited.

### **Once with Updates (`PSA_QST_INP_TYP_ONC_UPD`)**
- **Behavior**: A single instance of the questionnaire is associated with the context. The user can view and modify their previous answers.

### **Once Only (`PSA_QST_INP_TYP_ONC`)** *(Not yet supported)*
- **Behavior**: A single instance of the questionnaire is associated with the context. Once the questionnaire is submitted, it cannot be edited or resubmitted.

## Installation

Install the package into your scrivito portal app:

```shell
npm install psa-scr-qst-tst
```

### Importing and Initializing

Import the `initPisaQuestionnaireWidgets` function from the package and call it in your index.ts file found in the Widgets folder (e.g., in `src/Widgets/index.ts`). Make sure to provide the URL to your PisaSales REST API as the pisaUrl parameter:

```js
import { initPisaQuestionnaireWidgets } from "psa-scr-qst-tst";

// Replace "YOUR_PISA_API_URL" with the actual PisaSales REST API URL
initPisaQuestionnaireWidgets({ pisaUrl: "YOUR_PISA_API_URL" });

```

Import the `loadEditingConfigs` function from the package and call it in your editingConfigs.ts file also found in the Widgets folder.

```js
import { loadEditingConfigs } from "psa-scr-qst-tst/editing";

loadEditingConfigs();
```

Add the widget styles to your app.
This can be done by either loading the CSS via `css-loader` (e.g. in `src/index.js` or `src/Widgets/index.js`):

```js
import "psa-scr-qst-tst/index.css";
```

Or by importing the styles into your stylesheets (e.g. in `src/assets/stylesheets/index.scss`):

```scss
@import "psa-scr-qst-tst/index.css";
```

Add the editing styles in `scrivitoExtensions.scss`:

```scss
@import "psa-scr-qst-tst/editing.css";
```

## Local Development
