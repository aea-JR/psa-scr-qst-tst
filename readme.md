## Supported Questionnaire Input Types (Response Mode)

The `psa-scr-qst-tst` package supports multiple questionnaire input types, determining how answers are retrieved, submitted, and managed during usage. These modes are defined as follows:

### **Multiple Submissions (`PSA_QST_INP_TYP_REP`)**
- **Behavior**: A new set of answers is created every time the questionnaire is filled. Existing answers are not retrieved or edited.

### **Single Submission with Edits (`PSA_QST_INP_TYP_ONC_UPD`)**
- **Behavior**: A single instance of the questionnaire is associated with the context. The user can view and modify their previous answers.

### **Once Only (`PSA_QST_INP_TYP_ONC`)** *(Not supported)*
- **Behavior**: A single instance of the questionnaire is associated with the context. Once the questionnaire is submitted, it cannot be edited or resubmitted.

## Installation

Install the package into your scrivito portal app:

```shell
npm install psa-scr-qst-tst
```

### Importing and Initializing

Import the `initPisaQuestionnaireWidgets` function from the package and call it in your index.ts file found in the Widgets folder (e.g., in `src/Widgets/index.ts`). Make sure to provide the URL to your PisaSales REST API as the pisaUrl parameter:

```js
import { initPisaQuestionnaireWidgets } from "psa-scr-qst-tst";

// Replace "YOUR_PISA_API_URL" with the actual PisaSales REST API URL
initPisaQuestionnaireWidgets({ pisaUrl: "YOUR_PISA_API_URL" });

```

Import the `loadEditingConfigs` function from the package and call it in your editingConfigs.ts file also found in the Widgets folder.

```js
import { loadEditingConfigs } from "psa-scr-qst-tst/editing";

loadEditingConfigs();
```

Add the widget styles to your app.
This can be done by either loading the CSS via `css-loader` (e.g. in `src/index.js` or `src/Widgets/index.js`):

```js
import "psa-scr-qst-tst/index.css";
```

Or by importing the styles into your stylesheets (e.g. in `src/assets/stylesheets/index.scss`):

```scss
@import "psa-scr-qst-tst/index.css";
```

Add the editing styles in `scrivitoExtensions.scss`:

```scss
@import "psa-scr-qst-tst/editing.css";
```

## Local Development

To develop and test the package locally, follow these steps:

- Copy or clone the repository
- Navigate into the package directory.
- Install the package dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```
- Link the package locally: 
```shell
npm link
```
- Navigate into the Portal App
- Use the linked the package:
```shell
npm link psa-scr-qst-tst
```
- If you have a prevoius version installed, remove or outcomment the imported styles from `index.scss` and `scrivitoExtensions.scss`.
- follow [importing and initializing](#importing-and-initializing) instructions.
- Add the following snippet to your vite.config:

```js
 resolve: {
      alias: {
        'psa-scr-qst-tst': path.resolve(
          __dirname,
          '../psa-scr-qst-tst/src' 
        ),
       
      },
      dedupe: ['react', 'react-dom', 'scrivito'],
    }, 
```
- Add the following snippet to your tsconfig: 
```js
 "paths": {
      "psa-scr-qst-tst": ["../psa-scr-qst-tst/src"],
      "psa-scr-qst-tst/editing": ["../psa-scr-qst-tst/src/editing"]
    },
```
**Note:**
The Scrivito Portal App is built using Vite and will automatically compile the package, so there's no need to run `npm run build` or `npm run start` for local development.


## Questionnaire Creation and Updating

### Creating a Questionnaire

Before you can use or answer a questionnaire, it needs to be created in PisaSales. This can be done through the **PisaSales Questionnaire Management** tab in the properties of the questionnaire widget. When the creation process starts, the questionnaire, including all its questions and options, is created in PisaSales and becomes ready for use on your site.

### Updating a Questionnaire

The package automatically detects changes related to the questionnaire, such as modifications to questions, options, or other attributes. If changes are detected, you must manually push these updates to PisaSales via the **PisaSales Questionnaire Management** tab in the widget properties.

### Failure Handling
If creating or updating any question or answer option fails, the questionnaire will behave as if changes were detected, displaying a Pending Update message and button. This happens when the data in the Scrivito questionnaire no longer matches the data in PisaSales, allowing you to retry the update process to synchronize both systems.


## Questionnaire Usage Across Different Pages

The `psa-scr-qst-tst` package allows you to reuse questionnaires across different pages using the copy/duplicate functionality. This feature enables flexibility in how questionnaires are deployed and managed within your Scrivito project.

### Key Behaviors:
1. **Copying or Duplicating an Already Created Questionnaire:**
   - When you copy or duplicate a questionnaire that has already been created in PisaSales, its identifiers are retained.
   - This allows the same questionnaire to be reused across multiple pages without creating duplicates in PisaSales.

2. **Copying or Duplicating a New Questionnaire:**
   - If a questionnaire is copied or duplicated before it has been created in PisaSales, new identifiers will be generated upon creation.
   - This ensures that the duplicate behaves as an entirely new questionnaire in PisaSales.

3. **Copying or Pasting Individual Questions or Options:**
   - When individual questions or answer options are copied and pasted, new identifiers are always generated, regardless of whether the parent questionnaire is already created in PisaSales.

### Note on Identifiers:
Each questionnaire, question, and answer option is uniquely identified by both `externalId` and `GID`. These identifiers ensure proper synchronization and behavior between Scrivito and PisaSales.



## Review Feature

The Review feature allows users to review their answers before submitting a questionnaire with multiple steps. It provides a dialog where users can see all their responses at a glance.

### Review Dialog

### Closing the Dialog

Users can close the review dialog in two ways:

1. **Click Outside:** Clicking anywhere outside the dialog will close it.
2. **Close Button:** The dialog also includes a close button in the footer for users who prefer to close it manually.

It's important to note that the footer with the close button is not mandatory. Users can easily close the dialog using any of the methods mentioned above.

The Review feature is specifically designed for questionnaires with multiple steps, providing users with an opportunity to verify their responses before final submission.
